What is Rocket Car?
==========
Rocket Car is definitely not your traditional racing game. It takes car racing to a whole another level. By heading into outer space, and bending the laws of the universe to recreate terrestrial physics, we take you to hand-crafted racing tracks placed right next to planetary bodies so you can enjoy an extraterrestrial race!
